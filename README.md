# Deep-Learning-Using-ROS-and-TensorFlow

Worked with TensorFlow, which is an open source Python
library mainly for performing deep learning. Wrote basic code using TensorFlow
and later combined those capabilities with ROS for an image recognition application. After Tensorflow and deep learning, we used another Python library called scikit-
learn used for machine learning applications.
implemented SVM using scikit-learn. Later, we implemented a sample application using ROS and
scikit-learn for classifying sensor data.
